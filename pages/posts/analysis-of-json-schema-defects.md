## Context

While teaching back-end programming at [Mines Paris](https://minesparis.psl.eu/),
an engineering school which is part of [PSL University](https://psl.eu/), we have
looked at how JSON data could be validated when transfered from a front-end (eg react-native)
to a back-end (eg a REST API with Flask) and to storage (eg a Postgres database).

We have stumbled upon JSON Schema, and our investigation lead to an *academic* study
which analyses many schemas, finds common defects, and propose changes to the spec
which would rule out syntactically most of these defects, at the price of some contraints.
The results are described in
[this paper](https://www.cri.minesparis.psl.eu/classement/doc/A-794.pdf).

More precisely, the methodology consisted in
- reading all versions of the specs (yes, really!),
- collecting all the publicly schemas we could find (especially aggregating corpura from prior academic studies),
- writing several tools to analyze schemas and report *definite* or *probable* defects,
- looking at the reported defects to try to guess *why* these defects are there
  (most of the time some typo, a misplaced `}`, some type errorsâ€¦),
- thinking about what changes in the spec could rule out these schemas, while
  still allowing to describe JSON data structures.

Overall, the quality of publicly available schemas is not great:
Over **60%** of schemas are shown to have some type of defects, resulting in
unintended data to be validated, possibly risking system breakage or even cybersecurity issues.

The changes we recommend go beyond [Last Breaking Change](/blog/posts/the-last-breaking-change),
and somehow change the philosophy of the specification, so can be perceived as controversial.
At least, they reach their target, which is to turn most defects into errors.
Although the added restrictions would require to update existing schemas, we found
that a significant number of public schemas already conform to our proposed restrictions.

## Common Defects

Defects come mostly from JSON Schema lax independent keywords and loose defaults:
With JSON Schema, there is *no* constraint on where you put valid keywords, and
unknown keywords are silently ignored for ensuring *upward* compatibility.
As a result, mistyping, misnaming, misspelling or misplacing a keyword simply
results in the keyword being silently ignored, and these unintentional errors
tend to be stay in schemas without being ever detected.

Consider the following schema extract (line 614 of
[.NET Template](https://json.schemastore.org/template.json)), where `uniqueItems`
applies to a string, thus is ignored:

```json
{
  "type": "array",
  "items": {
    "type": "string",
    "uniqueItems": true
  }
}
```

Or this extract (line 55 of
[Azure Device Update Manifest](https://json.schemastore.org/azure-deviceupdate-manifest-definitions-4.0.json)),
where `propertyNames` applies to a string thus is also ignored.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": {
    "type": "string",
    "propertyNames": {
      "minLength": 1,
      "maxLength": 32
    }
  }
}
```

Or this extract (line 443 of [Fly](https://json.schemastore.org/fly.json)), where
the misplaced `additionalProperties` is taken as a forbidden property name.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "image": { "type": "string" },
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
```

We have found many other issues in our corpus of *57,800* distinct schemas.
We think that this can be significantly improved with limited changes to
the spec.

## Recommendations

Based on these evidences, we recommend to tighten the JSON Schema specification
by adding restrictions to keyword occurences. The stricter version of these
proposed changes are:

- type declarations, either explicit (`type`), implicit (`enum`, `const`, `$ref`),
  or through combinators (`allOf`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`) should be mandatory and appear
  only **once**, i.e. these keywords should be **exclusive**.
- type declarations should be simple scalars, i.e. union can only be achieved with combinators.
- type-specific keywords must appear only with their type, at the same level.
- unknown keywords must be rejected, although there should be some place for extensions,
  eg with prefixed property names such as `x-*`.
- about 20 seldom-used keywords could be removed, for various reasons:
  implementation complexity for `dynamicRef` and `dynamicAnchor`,
  understanding complexity for `if`/`then`/`else` (which can in most case be removed),
  underusage for some others.

Note that other syntactic and semantic changes could help reduce the number of defects
by ruling out some cases.

With these rules, the first two examples above become illegal.
We think that such changes result in schema descriptions which are easier to understand and
maintain.
Although some description tricks are not possible anymore with these
restrictions, we believe that they bring a significant software engineering benefit.
Moreover, many existing schemas already conform to these restrictive rules and
would not need to be changed at all.
