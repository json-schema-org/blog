## Overview

This repository contains the sources of JSON Schema blog website:

- It's powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- It uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS framework
- It is deployed using cloudflare pages

## Requirements

Use the following tools to set up the project:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14.17+
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) v1.22+

We recommend using [Volta](https://volta.sh/) to easily use the correct versions of node and yarn

For image compression to webp you can use the [`cwebp`](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download) CLI. Maybe this can be automated as a GitHub Action?

## Usage

### Install dependencies

To install all dependencies, run this command:

```bash
yarn
```

Yarn [automagically](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/install/) installs the correct dependencies you need, develop by default.

### Develop

Launch the development server with the hot reloading functionality that allows any change in files to be immediately visible in the browser (code only, not content). Use this command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

You can access the live development server at [localhost:8080/blog](http://localhost:8080/blog).

### Build

To build a production-ready website, run the following command:

```bash
yarn build
```

Generated files of the website go to the `.next` folder.
